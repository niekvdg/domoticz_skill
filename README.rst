This skill is for controlling Domoticz with the source voice assistant Mycroft.


Requirements
------------

-  `Python3`_.
-  `Domoticz`_.
-  `Mycroft`_.

Installation
-------------
Go to ~/mycroft-core/skills

git clone https://github.com/niekvdg/domoticz_skill

Configuration
-------------

Configure the Domoticz settings in your Mycroft account: https://account.mycroft.ai/skills

Name your devices in Domoticz like this: "Where What".  Mycroft will look for the device listed
in Domoticz. However the skill will also look for "What Where" as well.  Devices can also be
referenced by "What" alone but Mycroft will only fall back to that if it can't find the device
using "Where What" or "What Where".

Note:  Especially with weather sensors try to name your devices something that won't interfere
with other skills.  For instance naming a device "weather" could cause Mycroft to give you the
current stat for the device named "weather" if you ask "what's the weather" rather than telling
you what the current weather is via the weather skill.


Domoticz Groups and Scenes
-----

If you want Mycroft to do things like "turn off all the lights" in Domoticz then make a
scene or group named "all the lights" with all the lights in it and the skill will find this
group and operate the whole group rather than an individual object.  One caveat is that you
want to make the scene name distinct from the individual switch name.  Mycroft is not good
at picking out the "S" sound at the end of the word.  So a group with items in it called
Kitchen Light, Counter Light and Stove Light, won't work properly if you call the groups
name "Kitchen Lights".  Mycroft will trigger on "Kitchen Light" before it triggers on
"Kitchen Lights".  So if you say "Hey Mycroft turn off the kicthen lights" it will most
likely only turn off the light named "Kitchen Light".

Mycroft Settings Page
-----

The default settings for the domoticz connection and configuration is the local host without
authentication.
